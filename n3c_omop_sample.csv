Ferguson
Primary Service : CCM 1 Faulkner , Gonzalez E , M. D.
Hospital Day : 20 **This is being performed as an e consult due to hospital wide concerns about COVID 19 and reducing potential patient and healthcare personnel exposure.
REASON FOR CONSULT :
1) query immune reconsititution 2) anticoagulation assistance
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr.
Ferguson Mclellan Andersen is a ** y. o. male with medical comorbidities including follicular lymphoma diagnosed  7/11/2019  s / p cycle 1 rituximab / bendamustine (  2/6/20  ) , hypertension , bipolar disorder / depression who was admitted  3/23/2020  with acute respiratory failure in the setting of COVID 19 pneumonia.
Hematology was consulted for recommendations regarding anticoagulation.
Hematology was previously consulted on [4_3] for ongoing pancytopenia and abnormal peripheral smear.
In regards to his history of follicular lymphoma , it was diagnosed in  7/20/2019  and monitored until  1/20/2020  when treatment was started due to worsening pancytopenia < 100.
He received cycle 1 of rituximab / bendamustine on [2_6] .
When he returned for follow up on [3_5] , he screened positive for COVID 19.
He then developed worsening SOB and presented to the ED where labs showed WBC 3.
2 , hemoglobin 9 , platelet 171.
CT concerning for worsening bilateral ground glass opacities.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and BiPAP and was admitted to the MICU with acute respiratory failure.
He was quickly stabilized and transferred out of the ICU on [3_25] .
He received convalescent plasma on [3_27] per ID recs.
He required multiple transfusions during his hospital course.
Heme was consulted on [4_3] to evaluate smear showing slight bite cells , pincer red cells and spherocytes (consider oxidative / spherocytic hemolysis).
Faulkner was 270 , G 6 PD was normal / elevated , with no evidence of hemoglobinuria.
Retic count was normal at 1.
43%.
Heme felt that pancytopenia (stable in the upper 90 s , low 100 s) was multifactorial and possibly related to progression of malignancy (bone marrow biopsy  7/20/2019  already showed 60% marrow involvement) , bone marrow suppression from treatment , underlying liver disease.
In regards to the smear , they recommended outpatient follow up for G 6 PD levels in the future but had no ongoing concerns regarding hemolysis.
Since then , the patient was transferred back to the ICU on [4_5] due to increased oxygen requirements.
The patient was restarted on broad spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and zosyn.
CT chest showed marked progressive lung findings R>L consistent with advanced COVID infection.
LE US on [4_8] showed acute left calf DVT (left peroneal and soleal veins).
The patient had been on prophylactic lovenox but this was then transitioned to high intensity heparin nomogram but has had difficulty achieving therapeutic levels.
Antithrombin activity level was low at 61% on heparin.
On [4_9] , the patient was intubated and pressors were started.
He remains on norepinephrine and vasopressin as well as vanc / cefepime / flagyl.
Methylpred was started in addition to hydrocortisone stress dose steroids due to concern for immune reconstitution syndrome.
Labs show Hgb 9 (last pRBC yesterday x 2) , platelet count 291 , WBC 10.
5 , lactate 6.
5 , ABG pH 7.
11 , significantly elevated transaminases , total bilirubin 2.
5 , D dimer 1175 (stable since admission) , fibrinogen elevated 508 , no INR since [4_4] , ferritin 6900 , IL 6 elevated 15.
4 (admission) , CRP 206 , hyperphosphatemia , hyperkalemia , worsening renal failure.
TTE on [4_9] showed a moderately enlarged RV with mild moderately decreased systolic function , RVSP 53 , normal inspiratory collapse of IVC.
In speaking with the primary team , the patient has a daughter that they have been talking to.
His mom has dementia and is unable to make decisions for him.
He appears to live at home alone.

ASSESSMENT / PLAN :
Second trimester pregnancy.
Recommendations : Follow up visit is scheduled in four weeks , a prenatal ultrasound is scheduled for fetal anatomy.
Routine early ultrasound is beneficial in leading to early detection of clinically unsuspected malformations (including aneuploidies).
The safety of obstetrical ultrasound is well established.
For women who choose to undergo ultrasound screening for fetal structural anomalies , this is optimally performed in the second trimester (after 20 weeks EGA is standard at our facility).

(Resident Unlicensed DEA) GENERAL SURGERY CONSULT NOTE
CHIEF COMPLAINT / REASON FOR VISIT :
Abdominal pain
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Townsend Mcgregor is a ** yo F with history of CLL , T 2 DM , HTN , recently hospitalized for hypoxic respiratory failure due to Covid 19 pneumonia (  7/17/08  / 10) , who now presents to the hospital with acute onset abdominal pain after eating dinner.
During the patient's previous admission , she required high flow oxygen and was able to be weaned to room air over 3 days.
She received IV steroids , IV Remdesivir , convalescent plasma , IV Azithromycin and Rocephin.
She reports that after discharge , she was doing relatively well up until last night.
After eating dinner , she developed acute onset epigastric abdominal pain.
She initially thought it was just gas pains , so she rested and attempted to have a bowel movement.
She was able to have multiple small , soft bowel movements , no diarrhea or constipation.
However this did not improve her symptoms and the pain was severe enough to keep her from sleeping.
She spoke with her PCP who recommended she present to the ED.
In the ED , the patient was afebrile with HR 80 90's.
Labs were remarkable for leukocytosis to 18.
2 , lactate 1.
10.
CT abd / pelvis was obtained which showed a segment of jejunum with wall thickening and surrounding mesenteric congestion and edema , worrisome for nonocclusive ischemia.
It also captured her lung bases which showed severe but improved airspace disease consistent with history of Covid 19.
Due to the concern for mesenteric ischemia , General Surgery was consulted for further evaluation and management.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms.
Humphrey returns to us today.
Of note , she is a very pleasant ** year old female who we evaluated for a right sided cervical radiculopathy felt to be secondary to disk osteophyte complex at C 5 6.
We did send her for a transforaminal injection on the right side , which initially did not give her much relief , but now as the steroid effect has been taking effect over the last 10 days , she has noted more significant improvement in her symptoms with roughly 50% relief of her symptoms.
Otherwise , she is neurologically unchanged on today's visit.
ASSESSMENT / PLAN :
# 1 Neck and right upper extremity pain
# 2 Right cervical radiculopathy
# 3 Right sided C 5 6 , C 6 7 disk osteophyte complexes
# 4 Status post right sided C 5 6 transforaminal injection
At this time we did have a long discussion regarding her symptoms.
As they are improving , I think it would be reasonable to observe her symptoms for now and continue therapy.
Certainly , if her symptoms remain improved or continue to get better , no further intervention would be warranted.
However , we did discuss that if her symptoms become recurrent , depending on the timing of this , we can either discuss another injection versus potential surgical intervention.
We did discuss the options for surgical treatment including anterior fusion , anterior disk replacement , posterior foraminotomy.
She expressed understanding of the pros and cons of all these different options and all questions were answered.

REASON FOR CONSULT : Pre A Fib ablation discussion.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mrs.
Mckinney is a delightful ** year old female with a history of highly symptomatic atrial fibrillation , CHADS / VA Sc score of 4 , LV diastolic dysfunction , medically complicated obesity status post Calderon en Y gastric bypass , obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP , stage 3 CKD , diabetes mellitus type 2 , peripheral neuropathy , history of PE while on Premarin , and hypothyroidism.
I last saw the patient in [XXXXX] of this year.
She was clearly highly symptomatic with atrial fibrillation , noting fatigue , loss of energy , lightheadedness , and palpitations.
She was on metoprolol as well as diltiazem.
She has noted she has dealt with atrial fibrillation since the late [xxxxx x. xxxxx] was back in [XXXXX] when she felt that she was presumably in A Fib since then and ever since her intussusception and hospitalization back in [XXXXX] where she has been persistently in A Fib.
She clearly is aware of when she is in A Fib , and she definitely does not feel as good as when she is in sinus rhythm.
We had scheduled her for amiodarone loading which had initially required her , given her A Fib with RVR , to be in the hospital.
Of note , prior to this cardioversion , a sinus rhythm occurred  2/16/2020  , and she had a marked improvement in symptoms.
However , she relapsed several times requiring trips to the emergency department and repeat cardioversions with additional loading of amiodarone.
She was admitted prior to her scheduling for pulmonary vein isolation in [XXXXX] .
This occurred in the setting of an unfortunate COVID 19 infection noted  4/22/2020  rd.
She was initially scheduled for ablation on  4/25/2020  .
She re increased her amiodarone to 400 mg b. i. d. and has been on this 200 mg twice a day since.
She has finally converted to sinus rhythm at some point in the interim.
She has noticed a marked improvement in her symptoms , and she wishes to proceed with pulmonary vein isolation.
Of note , her last PCR SARS was undetectable  5/22/2020  .
She is scheduled for upcoming MRI imaging and additional testing , and she is also planned for pulmonary vein isolation with me  6/21/2020  .
ASSESSMENT / PLAN :
# 1 Highly symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
# 2 Medically complicated obesity , status post gastric bypass with a Roux en Y # 3 Diabetes mellitus type 2
# 4 Probable diastolic dysfunction I had a long discussion with Mrs.
Matthews , and we discussed in detail the rationale of the procedure which would include a PVI and possibly a CTI for her atrial fibrillation therapy.
We discussed we will keep her on amiodarone , and she should deescalate to 200 mg once daily from now on.
We will plan for a 3 month course of amiodarone postablation , and then we will plan to stop amiodarone.
She will continue apixaban lifelong.
I also discussed we will put her on Prilosec b. i. d. postablation for 1 month.
I discussed with her the rationale and outlined the procedural steps that will occur.
She will need to be n. p. o. the night prior , and she should continue amiodarone and apixaban with small sips of water morning of.
In addition , she will get a cardiac MRI , and we should also set her up for a TEE if possible.
She will get repeat coronavirus testing as well as IgG testing.
She is agreeable to the plan and excited to proceed.
We will obtain formal consent morning of when we meet each other in the PACU.

Finnegan :
Ms.
Finnegan Mckinney Matthews is a ** y. o. female with a past medical history of COVID 19 infection , mild intermittent asthma , and chronic myofascial pain syndrome who presented today for dizziness.
# 1 Dizziness
Mrs.
Mcarthur was seen today for evaluation of abrupt onset dizziness that occurred 2 days ago.
She is accompanied by her husband who is serving as her interpreter.
She developed abrupt onset dizziness 2 days ago in the morning.
When she proceeded to arise from a seated to standing position , she developed abrupt onset room spinning dizziness with laterality primarily to the right.
Shortly thereafter , she felt off balance which resulted in a fall.
She explains to me that she hit her head on a wall , but did not lose consciousness.
This dizziness was also accompanied by nausea , but no vomiting.
She did not have any additional prodromal symptoms such as chest discomfort , dyspnea , palpitations , or presyncope.
She did not have any additional accompanying symptoms such as hearing loss , tinnitus , or focal neurologic symptoms.
This dizziness persisted over a 24 hour period and was exacerbated with head movements , particularly when turning in bed and gazing upwards.
Her symptoms resolved yesterday morning after she implemented “exercises” that she and her husband looked up on You Tube.
These were described as going from a seated position on her bed , to lying down with her head over the edge of the bed (possibly Mcgregor maneuver).
She also increased her fluid intake.
She did not utilize any over the counter medications.
She does not have a history of vertigo and has not experienced symptoms similar to this previously.
No fever / chills , headache , vision changes , photophobia , sonophobia , speech changes , numbness or tingling , focal weakness , vomiting , gait changes , hearing loss , or tinnitus.
Of note , she works 12 hour shifts at Seneca Foods performing assembly work , and works up to 6 7 days per week.
She and her husband are requesting a letter to be excused from work related duties through Monday ,  8/22/2020  if possible.
